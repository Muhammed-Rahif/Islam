<p>The Islam Application is a mobile app created for Muslims, offering access to the Quran, Sunnah, and Dhikrs. The app is designed to serve as a valuable resource for Muslims who are looking to enhance their knowledge and practice of Islam.

The app has been developed with the intention of being a source of reward for its contributors. Contributors to the app can earn sadaqah jariyah, a form of ongoing charity that continues to benefit the giver even after they have passed away, by contributing to its development.

The Islam Application has been built using the Ionic iOS theme, and offers both dark and white modes for the user's convenience. We welcome contributions to the app from the community, and encourage contributors to refer to the CONTRIBUTING.md file for guidelines on how to contribute.

We hope that the Islam Application will prove to be a valuable resource for Muslims worldwide, and we welcome your feedback and suggestions on how we can improve the app further.</p>
